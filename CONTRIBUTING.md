## Information about the project

### Creating new files in the library
Our code generator, Plop, is designed to simplify the creation of frequently used boilerplate code. To utilize it, execute the command `npm run plop`. If you want to learn more about Plop, you can find additional information [here](https://plopjs.com/).
Currently, our Plop code generator supports the creation of the following:
1. Tests
2. Component story documentation pages
3. Hook story documentation pages
4. Entirely new components, which include tests and story pages

We strongly recommend utilizing our Plop code generator within this repository for generating any of the mentioned items. Doing so ensures that your code will be created with the latest recommended structure, providing a solid foundation for your development tasks.

### API
If you add new features or abilities to an existing component, please ensure your props' naming follows our conventions and best practices. Read more about it [here](./API_GUIDELINES.MD).

### Storybook
As the main development environment and documentation playground, we are using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).
Each component should be developed in isolation in the Storybook environment.
You can read more about our docs implementation best practices [here](COMPONENTS_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md).

### Theming
Every component should support theming, you can find more information about it [here](THEME_README.md).

### Tests and coverage
All the guidelines about testing your new component or changes to the existing one you can find [here](TESTING_README.md).

### Linting
We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) with the default community guidelines. Please, make sure that you are formatting your code with prettier.

### Commits
We are using [Semantic commits](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716) convention for creating Pull Requests and commits messages inside of the Pull Request.
